## 4. Jane requests babysitting; Elizabeth is accepted and they decide where the child will stay

- Primary persona: Jane Miller (The Parent & Student) as Consumer; Elizabeth Taylor as Provider
- Goal: Consumer posts a need, reviews applicant(s), accepts a provider, completes the need, and the parties decide whether the child will stay at the consumer's home or the provider's home.

Steps:
1. Jane posts a babysitting need with date/time and required skills.
2. Elizabeth applies; Jane reviews Elizabeth's profile, past tags, and any caregiver qualifications (biography) (SM-7).
3. Jane accepts Elizabeth and the system opens a private chat thread for logistics and permissions (SM-9) and the system prompts evaluations (SM-10).
4. During the chat they explicitly agree which home the child will stay in during the session (Jane's home or Elizabeth's home), and the system records the chosen location and any special instructions or permissions.
5. Status transitions to "Scheduled" and reserved hours are held from Jane's balance (SM-8, TCS-3).
6. After the session they mark the need as complete; both confirm completion and the system transfers time credits to Elizabeth (TCS-5).

Requirement mapping: SM-7, SM-9, SM-8, TCS-5, SM-10, (TCS-3 implicitly referenced)

Acceptance criteria:
- Consumers can view applicants, accept one, and initiate a private message.
- The private chat supports recording of agreed location (home of consumer or provider) and any necessary permissions.
- Status updates follow the expected flow: Open -> Applied -> Scheduled -> In-progress -> Complete.
- Time credit reservation and transfer occur atomically on completion confirmation.
- Both parties can submit ratings; system prevents fake duplicate evaluations.

Edge cases:
- Provider cancels after acceptance (system offers rescheduling or refund path to consumer and releases reserved hours).
- Disagreement about location or permissions arises (system records pre-session agreement and offers mediation/escalation flow).
- Consumer fails to confirm completion (escalation/reminder flow to ensure fairness).

## 5. Alex completes a moving-help request and checks balances and caps

- Primary persona: Alex Chen (The Curious Newcomer)
- Goal: Provide help with moving, confirm completion, see transferred time credits, and ensure balances respect caps.

Steps:
1. Alex is accepted for a moving-help need and the system reserves the agreed hours from the consumer (TCS-3).
2. He completes the job and both parties confirm completion (TCS-5).
3. System transfers hours and updates both users' balances; if Alex's new balance would exceed cap, credits are capped and overflow handled per policy (TCS-4).
4. Alex receives a short survey about consumer and the task (SM-11).
5. The updated balance is visible on Alex's profile (TCS-2).

Requirement mapping: TCS-3, TCS-5, TCS-2, TCS-4, SM-11

Acceptance criteria:
- Hour reservation prevents double-booking and shows in both user dashboards.
- Completion of mutual confirmation triggers the transfer of hours (or applies cap rules correctly).
- Balance display reflects new balance and any capped amounts with clear messaging.
- Provider receives and can submit the post-service survey.

Edge cases:
- Transfer would exceed recipient's balance cap (system credits up to cap and queues/returns remainder according to policy).
- One party disputes completion (initiates Admin moderation flow).
- Network or service failure during transfer (system retries and notifies users of transient state).
