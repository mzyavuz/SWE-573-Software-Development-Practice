## 1. Introduction



### 1.1 Purpose

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document provides a comprehensive description of the Hive platform, a community-based TimeBank system that facilitates skill and service exchanges using time as currency. This document is intended for:
- Project stakeholders (The neighbors, developer & instructor/guidance counselor) and product owners (Me)
- Future developers (For extra features)
- Academic instructor (Suzan Üskdarlı)


### 1.2 Scope

Hive is a web-based TimeBank platform that enables community members to exchange skills and services using time credits (hours) as the medium of exchange. The system allows users to:
- Create "Offers" (services they can provide) and "Needs" (services they require)
- Search and filter services using semantic tags, location, and availability
- Apply for and accept service exchanges
- Communicate through automated private messaging
- Track time credit balances and transactions
- Review service exchanges
- Participate in community forums

The platform includes:
- User authentication and profile management
- Map-based service discovery
- TimeBank currency system with transaction management
- Semantic tagging system for categorizing services
- Administrative dashboard for moderation and oversight
- Community forum for active discussions

## 2. Overall Description



### 2.1 Product Perspective

Hive is a standalone web-based platform that operates independently, though it may interface with:
- **Email Service Providers** for user verification and notifications
- **Mapping Services** (e.g., OpenStreetMap, Google Maps) for location-based service discovery
- **Database Systems** for persistent data storage (user accounts, services, transactions, messages)

The system architecture includes:
- Frontend web application (responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers)
- Backend API server handling business logic and data management
- Database layer for structured data storage

The platform is designed to be self-contained with the potential for future integration with calendar applications, file storage system for media assets, email notification system, or external community platforms.



### 2.2 Product Functions

The Hive platform provides the following high-level functions:

1. **User Management**: Registration, authentication, profile management, and role-based access control
2. **Service Management**: Creation, editing, deletion, and lifecycle management of Offers and Needs
3. **Discovery & Search**: Map-based visualization, filtering by tags/location/time, and text search
4. **Application & Matching**: Providers apply for Needs, Consumers review and select Providers
5. **Communication**: Automated private messaging between matched users
6. **TimeBank System**: Initial credits, balance tracking, hour reservation, and transaction processing
7. **Rating & Feedback**: Mutual evaluation after service completion and provider surveys
8. **Semantic Tagging**: User-generated and admin-managed tags for service categorization
9. **Community Forum**: Discussion threads for community engagement
10. **Administration**: User moderation, content management, dispute resolution, and reporting dashboards

- Given a user submits a rating (1-5 stars) and optional review, when they save it, then the rating is permanently associated with the other user's profile.
- Given a user views another user's profile, when the page loads, then they see the average rating and recent reviews.
- Given a Provider completes a Need, when they submit their evaluation, then they also fill a survey about task difficulty and accuracy.
