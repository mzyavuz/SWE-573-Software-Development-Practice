# Demo Scenario

Elif is standing in her living room, staring down a small mountain of laundry. It’s the usual suspects—her husband’s favorite shirt has popped a button, and her son’s school trousers have a hole in the knee. She could easily take them to a tailor, but she’s thinking, *"No, I want to learn how to do this myself."* She doesn't just want a fix; she wants the skill.

So, she grabs her phone and logs into **Hive**.

Her first thought is, *"Maybe there's a group discussing this?"* She heads straight to **The Commons**—that’s the community forum area. She jumps into the "Project Collaboration" category and searches for "Sewing". She’s hoping to find a lively thread of neighbors sharing tips, but all she finds is a "Knitting Circle" thread that hasn’t been touched in four months. Dead end.

She doesn't give up. She switches over to the **Service Map** to see who is nearby. The map loads, centered right on her neighborhood, and she filters the view by the tag **"Sewing"**.

Suddenly, the map clears up and leaves just one pin a few streets over!She clicks on it. It’s an Offer from a user named Ahmet.

The Offer title reads: "Professional Tailor Shop - Repairs & Alterations." The location is marked as Ahmet's shop. The description looks great: "Come to my fully equipped workshop for fast repairs."

Elif thinks, "Perfect! If I go to his shop, he'll have all the professional tools to show me."

She clicks "Apply" (or selects the Offer), and the system opens a Private Messaging channel.

Elif types: "Hi Ahmet! I see you have a shop nearby. I actually want to learn how to do repairs myself. Can I come to your shop this Monday? I’m happy to use my Time Credits to 'rent' your expertise for an or two hours."

A minute later, Ahmet propose a date on Monday at 10 to 12. Elif happily accepts the time since it works for her because she can drop her son to school and go to the shop after that. However, after accepting the proposal Ahmet writes: "Hello Elif. You are welcome to come to the shop. However, I can't pay the rent with Time Credits. If you want a lesson in the shop, I charge 1 Time Credit in the app plus 300 TL cash for the workshop fee."

Elif freezes. Red flag. She knows the rules—Hive is a TimeBank, meant for equitable exchange, not a marketplace for side hustles. Ahmet lured her in with a clean profile, only to demand cash in the private chat.

She doesn't reply. Instead, she taps the "Report Issue" button below "Change Schedule" at the right section of the page. She writes "Soliciting Money" as the reason. The system reports the service for the Admins to review later.

Now she’s back to square one, but she’s determined. She decides to take control and post her own request. She goes to "Create Need"."*

Elif shakes her head. She knows the rules—Hive is a **TimeBank**; it’s about exchanging time, not money. Ahmet is trying to run a commercial shop on the community platform. She decides to be a good citizen and hits the **Report** button, flagging Ahmet's offer for "Commercial Activity" so the admins can review it later.

Since Ahmet was a bust, Elif decides to put her own request out there. She goes to **"Create Need"**.

She types it out clearly: *"Teach me basic clothing repair."* In the description, she writes, *"I don't need you to fix it for me. I need someone to sit with me for 2 hours and teach me how to sew a button. I'll provide the tea!"* She tags it with **Sewing** and **Education**, and the system sets aside 2 hours from her balance to cover it.

A few hours later, her phone buzzes. It’s a notification: **Sevim** has applied to her Need.

Elif taps on Sevim’s profile. She sees that Sevim is a retired teacher with a 5-star rating. She looks perfect. Elif clicks **"Select Provider,"** and boom—the system locks those 2 hours from her account and instantly opens a private chat between them.

Elif types: *"Hi Sevim! Thanks for helping. Are you free this Saturday?"*

Saturday rolls around, Sevim comes over, and they spend a lovely afternoon drinking tea and stitching shirts. When Sevim leaves, she marks the job complete on her phone. Elif confirms it, and those 2 hours zip from her account to Sevim’s. They leave each other glowing reviews, and Elif finally knows how to fix that button.
