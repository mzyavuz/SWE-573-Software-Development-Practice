## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is The Hive?

The Hive is a community-based TimeBank platform that enables neighbors to exchange skills and services using time as currency instead of money. Every hour of service is valued equally - whether you're teaching guitar, helping with gardening, or providing tech support, one hour equals one time credit.

### 1.2 How Does It Work?

**The Basic Concept:**
- You join the community and receive 1 hour of time credit to start
- Offer services you can provide (Offers)
- Request services you need (Needs)
- Exchange time credits when services are completed
- Build community connections while helping each other

**Key Features:**
- 🗺️ **Map-Based Discovery**: Find services near you on an interactive map
- ⏰ **TimeBank Balance**: Track your time credits (10-hour maximum)
- 📅 **Schedule Proposals**: Coordinate service timing with balance validation
- 💬 **Private Messaging**: Communicate directly with matched users
- ⭐ **Ratings & Reviews**: Build trust through community feedback
- 🏷️ **Semantic Tags**: Categorize and discover services easily

### 1.3 Who Can Use The Hive?

Anyone in your community! Whether you're:
- A student offering tutoring in exchange for help moving
- A retiree sharing art history knowledge for tech support
- A parent needing babysitting in exchange for proofreading
- A teen running errands to earn tutoring hours

## 3. Understanding the TimeBank System

### 3.1 What Are Time Credits?

Time credits (also called TimeBank Hours) are the currency of The Hive platform. They represent hours of service given or received.

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ 1 hour of any service = 1 time credit
- ✅ All skills are valued equally
- ✅ Credits are earned by providing services
- ✅ Credits are spent by receiving services

### 3.2 Your Initial Balance

When you join The Hive, you receive:
- **1 hour of time credit** to start
- This allows you to request a service right away
- Or you can provide a service first to build your balance

### 3.3 Balance Rules

**Minimum Balance:**
- Can be 0 hours (but you can't request services)
- Can never go negative

**Maximum Balance:**
- **10 hours maximum** per user
- This ensures active participation and fairness
- Once you reach 10 hours, you must use credits before earning more

### 3.4 Checking Your Balance

Your balance is always visible:
1. Top right corner of every page
2. Dashboard balance widget
3. Profile page

**Balance Display Shows:**
- Current balance (e.g., "7 hours")
- Pending schedule proposals 

### 3.5 How Credits Transfer

**When You Provide a Service (Provider):**
1. Complete the service
2. Consumer confirms completion
3. Credits transfer from Consumer to Provider
4. Your balance increases

**When You Receive a Service (Consumer):**
1. Accept a schedule proposal (credits reserved)
2. Service is completed
3. You confirm completion
4. Credits transfer to Provider
5. Your balance decreases

**Important:** Credits only transfer after **mutual confirmation** of service completion.

### 3.6 Balance Warnings

The system will warn you if:
- ⚠️ Your balance is insufficient for a service request
- ⚠️ Accepting a proposal would exceed the provider's 10-hour cap
- ⚠️ You're approaching your maximum balance

## 14. Frequently Asked Questions

### 14.1 Getting Started

**Q: How much does it cost to join The Hive?**  
A: The Hive is completely free! No money changes hands - only time credits.

**Q: Do I need to provide a service before requesting one?**  
A: No! You start with 1 free hour that you can use right away. You can either provide a service first or use your free hour to receive a service.

**Q: What if I don't have any special skills?**  
A: Everyone has something to offer! Simple tasks like errands, moving help, walking dogs, or listening ears are valuable to others.

**Q: How do I know if someone is trustworthy?**  
A: Check their profile for:
- Average rating from other users
- Reviews describing their past services
- Number of completed services
- How long they've been a member

---

### 14.2 Time Credits

**Q: Why is there a 10-hour maximum balance?**  
A: The cap ensures:
- Active participation (use your hours!)
- Fair distribution across community
- Prevents hoarding
- Encourages ongoing exchanges

**Q: What happens if I reach the 10-hour cap?**  
A: You must use some hours before earning more. Request a service you need!

**Q: Can time credits expire?**  
A: No! Your credits never expire as long as your account is active.

**Q: What if someone doesn't show up for a scheduled service?**  
A: Your reserved hours are released back to your balance. You can report the issue to admins if it happens repeatedly.

**Q: Are all services worth the same time credits?**  
A: Yes! One hour of any service equals one time credit. A software developer's hour equals a gardener's hour.

---

### 14.3 Services

**Q: Can I edit a service after posting?**  
A: Yes, as long as no one has been matched yet. After accepting an applicant, some fields become locked.

**Q: How long do services stay active?**  
A: Services remain active until:
- You delete them
- You complete the service
- An admin removes them (for violations)

**Q: Can I post the same service multiple times?**  
A: Yes! If you want to help multiple people with the same skill, create separate service posts for each.

**Q: What's the difference between Offer and Need?**  
A: 
- **Offer** = You provide service, you earn hours
- **Need** = You receive service, you spend hours

**Q: Can I apply to my own service?**  
A: No, that's not allowed. You can't apply to services you created.

---

### 14.4 Applications

**Q: How many people can I accept for one service?**  
A: Only ONE. Once you accept someone, other applications are automatically rejected.

**Q: Can I un-accept someone?**  
A: Not easily. Once accepted, you're committed. Only cancel if absolutely necessary, and communicate clearly with the other person.

**Q: Why was my application rejected?**  
A: Service owners can choose anyone for various reasons:
- Availability mismatch
- Lack of experience
- Another applicant was better fit
- Location distance
Don't take it personally!

**Q: How long should I wait before applying to more services?**  
A: You can apply to multiple services at once! Just don't over-commit yourself.

---

### 14.5 Schedule & Completion

**Q: What if we need to reschedule?**  
A: Either party can create a new schedule proposal. Discuss via messages first.

**Q: What happens if I can't complete a service?**  
A: Communicate immediately with the other person. Try to reschedule or find a replacement. Cancelling without notice harms your reputation.

**Q: Why do both people need to confirm start and completion?**  
A: Dual confirmation:
- Prevents disputes
- Creates clear record
- Ensures mutual agreement
- Protects both parties

**Q: What is the 48-hour auto-confirm?**  
A: If Consumer doesn't confirm completion within 48 hours of Provider marking complete, the system automatically confirms and transfers credits. This protects Providers from non-responsive Consumers.

---

### 14.6 Safety & Privacy

**Q: Is my personal information safe?**  
A: Yes! We only share:

- Rating
Your email, phone, date of birth, and exact balance are private.

A: Yes! Use the "Report" button on services, messages, or reviews. Admins review within 48 hours.
